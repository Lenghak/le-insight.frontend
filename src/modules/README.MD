# SRC / MODULES

Module is a project folder that serves as a container for various application services that are critical to the functionality of the software.

It is designed to house a collection of independent, reusable code modules that can be easily integrated into different parts of the application.

The module folder provides a structured environment for developing, testing, and deploying these services, ensuring that they are well-organized, maintainable, and scalable.

## Responsibilities

- Providing a common framework for building and deploying application services.

- Ensuring that services are loosely coupled and independent, allowing for easy maintenance and updates.

- Encapsulating service-specific configuration and dependencies.

- Facilitating collaboration and code reuse among development teams.

- Enforcing best practices and coding standards for service development
Simplifying the deployment and management of services across different environments.

By using a module folder, developers can create a modular, flexible, and scalable application that can be easily customized and adapted to meet changing business needs.
